What you did well:
- You have a detailed profiling.
- You seem to have tried the naive paralleling of the problem.
- You have tried serial tuning  such as unrolling loops.
Suggestions for improvement:
- Check the correctness of the naive parallel implementation via looking at the mp4 generated by visualizer. Because when we applied it (naive parallel) on the C version code of Professor Bindel's development, the result was initially not correct - it took us quite a while to debug this.
- Maybe try Professor Bindel's c version of the code which has already been tuned for good serial performance.
- Try domain decomposition
